# basemaps-assets
Fonts and sprites for [basemaps](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps).

Customized by KotobaMedia for Japanese maps. While most maps will have local ideographs
set, there are some applications where this is not the case. To cover these cases,
use this font server.

* `Noto Sans Regular` and `Noto Sans Medium` have Noto Sans CJK (Japanese) glyphs included.
* `Noto Sans Italic` is unchanged (Japanese fonts do not support italics)

## Directory Structure

* `fonts/`: Contains PBF glyphs generated by [build_pbf_glyphs](https://github.com/stadiamaps/sdf_font_tools/tree/main/build_pbf_glyphs)
  * Install with `cargo install build_pbf_glyphs`
  * Current fonts: `Noto Sans Regular`, `Noto Sans Medium`, `Noto Sans Italic`
 
* `sprites/v3`: Contains spritesheets generated by [spreet](https://github.com/flother/spreet), for each major version
  * `light@x.png` - light and dark themed spritesheets at 1x and 2x pixel densities

## Fonts

The typefaces and font variants hosted and downloadable here are limited to only those used by [basemaps](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps) and a Noto Sans alternate. It is not meant to include all possible variations or other fonts. If you want to generate fonts for your own use, use the examples in `scripts` and maintain your own repository.
